## When to create an issue?
- Identifying a Bug (something's broken)
- Requesting an Enhancement (something could be better)
- Suggesting a change (to improve the user or developer experience)
- Asking a question (perhaps guidance can be improved)

## When not to create an issue?
- General feedback (eg: great job! Or I don't like the color blue)
- Conversation without a resolution

> Use the Yammer group or email innovate@its.ny.gov if your issue does not seem to fit with the criteria above.

## Creating Issues

- Search and review the current issues to see if anyone else has already reported it (Duplicate issues will be closed).
- If your issue is a duplicate of another issue, read the original issue, as comments may give enough temporarily information until a permanent solution is fully realized.
- Keep issues, and comments contstructive and respectful (GitHub is a public place... deconstrutive comments will be deleted).
- Abstract your problem... avoid mentioning names or any information that may be sensitive.
- Review the "Mastering Issues" GitHub Tutorial https://guides.github.com/features/issues/

### Problem Identification

#### When creating an issue, please provide all possible of the following:

  - Screenshot illustrating issue
  - URL that currently exhibits the problem (Might not be possible for all people)
  - Operating System, Browser/version
  - Whether or not you are behind an aggressive firewall or not (many state agencies are)
  - Detailed description of your issue.
  - Steps needed to replicate the issue.

> Issues that do not follow the contributing.md guidelines may be closed.

##### Determining Issue Effect Scope
- Issues effect may be to a single browser, device, physical location, site instance, or other subsets of users.
- If issues are not immediately apparent to affect a large portion of the userbase, they will be put into the milestone "Instance Issues" where research can be done to further define the effect scope and to get peer assistance.
- If after research, an issue's scope is understood, it may be brought back to a global milestone.

##### Steps to Determine Scope
- Determine if someone else can replicate the issue with the same device/OS/browser.
- Determine in the issue is just affecting your site/app or if it is more widespread (see the [site tracking spreadsheet](http://on.ny.gov/110a8hc) to find other sites to test against)
- Test in multiple browsers and devices (ask others for assistance if there is a certain target device you need to test).
- Summarize all your results at the very top of the issue for easy reference.

## Issue Naming
- Create descriptive names that represent the nature of the problem, rather than your site or instance.
- Propose a renaming of an issue in a comment if you do not have the ability to change it directly.

## Labels

### Each issue should have minimum required labels

#### If you don't have the ability to add labels write them in your description or comment and they will be added for you.

- product (required)
  - Guidance and Demos
  - Universal Navigation
    - version (required)
    - type (requried)
    - status
    - priority
      - critical: impacts all users or all users of a certain site
      - moderate: only impacts subset of users

### Reference
- See other optional labels at https://github.com/nys-its/universal-navigation/labels

Create an issue if any of the labels need more clarification

## Getting Things Done 
- Milestones https://github.com/nys-its/universal-navigation/milestones
- Issues will be tasked to a milestone (by an admin) so that sprints can be scoped and there is an indication of when issues will be addressed.
- If you re-milestone an issue, comment to communicate your rational, or discuss before moving.
- Create an issue if any milestones could be better named or described.
- If you can fix an issue yourself (guidance and demos for this repo), assign yourself to an issue, or comment to claim (admin will assign).
- If contributing, [Fork the repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo), make changes and [create a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) (If that's "all greek to you"... just help contribute to issues for now... we'll share tutorials at a later date)

## ProTips
- Reference other issues by typing their number in your comment (EX: "This is a sub issue of #33") (#33 comes from url: https://github.com/ny/universal-navigation/issues/33)
